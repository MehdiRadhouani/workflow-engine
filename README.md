Akka Workflow engine
====================

### Requirements
* JDK8 [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html))
* sbt([http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html))
* docker for dockerbuild ([https://www.docker.com/community-edition/](https://www.docker.com/community-edition/))

### Implemented Features

* Integration of *swagger-ui* ```localhost:9090/v1/swagger/index.html```
* Autogenerated swagger doc from routes as yaml / json ```localhost:9090/v1/api-docs/swagger.yaml``` or ```localhost:9090/v1/api-docs/swagger.json```
* CRUD Repositorys via *slick-repo*
* CORS Support via *akka-http-cors*
* Test coverage with *ScalaTest* and *scoverage* code coverage report
* Ready for *Docker* deployment and *CloudFormation* deployment
* Config file with optional runtime parameters
* In-Memory Postgres SQL database for tests
* *HikariCP* as connection pool
* Logging via *Log4j* with a xml template

## Configuration
* Start a PostgreSQL Database via RDS, Docker or locally
* We need to enable hstore
```
Hstore CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS hstore;
```
* Configure your application.conf and the docker.conf (`src/main/resources/`) (application.conf in test has to stay as it is, for running in a in-memory postgresql instance)

### Environment variables 
- `SQL_URL` - database url by scheme `jdbc:postgresql://host:port/database-name`
- `SQL_USER` - database user
- `SQL_PASSWORD` - database password

## Run application
To run application, call:
```
sbt run
```
If you wanna restart your application without reloading of sbt, use (*revolver* sbt plugin):
```
sbt re-start
```

### Run in Docker
For launching application in Docker, you must configure database docker instance and run docker image, generated by sbt.

Generating application docker image and publishing on localhost:
```
sbt docker:publishLocal
```

Example of running, generated docker image:
```
docker run --name akkaHttp -e SQL_USER=dbuser -e SQL_PASSWORD=dbpass -e SQL_URL=jdbcURL -d -p 9090:9000 APPLICATION_IMAGE
```
- `APPLICATION_IMAGE` - id or name of application docker image

look at ```--link``` parameter if the database is also a docker container

## Test
To run tests, call:
```
sbt test
```

To run all tests, with codecoverage, call:

```
sbt clean coverage test
```

To generate a coverage report afterwars the testrun, call:

```
sbt coverageReport
```
